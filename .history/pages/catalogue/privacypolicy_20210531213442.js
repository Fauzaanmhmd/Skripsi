                    Respecting your privacy is embedded in our DNA. Since we started Reswara, we have aspired to build our services with a strong set of privacy principles.
                    

                    Collection and Use of Personal Information

                    Personal information is data that can be used to identify or contact a single person. You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with Reswara or its affiliated companies. Reswara and its affiliates may share this personal information with each other and use it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. They may also combine it with other information to provide and improve our products, services and content. You are not required to provide the personal information we ask for, but, if you choose not to do so, in most cases we will not be able to provide you with our products or services or answer any questions you may have.

                    

                    The following are some examples of the types of personal information Reswara may collect and how we can use it:

                    What personal information do we collect?

                    When you create a Reswara Website Account, we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, telephone number, email address, contact preferences, device identifier, IP address, location information, credit card information and profile information where the contact is via social media.

                    In certain jurisdictions, we may request a government-issued ID in limited circumstances including when creating a wireless account and activating your device, for purposes of expanding commercial purposes, administering services, or as required by law.

                    How do we use your personal information?

                    We collect your name, email address, address, telephone number and the products you sell.

                    We use this information to provide you with our services; for example, to verify your identity, contact you, provide you with support and updates, marketing purposes, and invoicing. We also use this information to ensure that we comply with legal requirements.

                    We will also use personal information in other cases where you have given us your consent. We use this information to provide you with access to and improve our Services; for example, to make the interface of our platform easier to use. We also use this information to personalize the Service for you. Finally, we may use this information to provide you with advertising or marketing materials.

                    

                    Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information

                    We also collect data in a form that does not, by itself, allow direct contact with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. The following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we can use it:

                    Cookie Tracking Technology

                    Cookies are small amounts of data that act as unique identifiers. Cookies are stored on your device. We use cookies to recognize your device and provide you with a personalized experience on our websites and services.

                    Disclosures to Third Parties

                    Sometimes Reswara may provide certain personal information to third parties to provide or improve our products and services, including to deliver products at your request, or to help market Reswara to consumers. When we do, we ask a third party to handle it in accordance with the relevant law. Personal information will never be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes. If you are approved for the service, your account will be governed by Reswara and your respective operator’s privacy policies.

                    Service Providers

                    Reswara shares personal information with companies that provide services such as information processing, adding credit, fulfilling customer orders, delivering products to you, managing and improving customer data, providing customer service, assessing your interest in our products and services, and conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys. These companies are obliged to protect your information and can be located wherever Reswara operates.

                    Others

                    All Reswara Privacy Policies will comply to and be in accordance with Law Number 11 of 2008 regarding Electronic Information and Transactions, as amended by Law Number 19 of 2016 regarding Amendments to Law Number 11 of 2008 on Electronic Information and Transactions, Government Regulations Number 71 of 2019 regarding Implementation of Electronic Systems and Transactions, Regulation of the Minister of Communication and Information Technology Number 20 of 2016 regarding Protection of Personal Data in Electronic Systems, and other related regulations that apply in the Republic of Indonesia.

                    Reswara has the absolute authority to revise, change, and/or add provisions to the Information Confidentiality Policy without the user’s consent.

                    It may be necessary – by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence – for Reswara to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other matters of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate. We may also disclose information about you, but only if there is a valid basis for doing so, if we determine that disclosure is necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users. This can include providing information to public or governmental authorities. In addition, in the event of a reorganization, merger or sale, we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to related third parties.
